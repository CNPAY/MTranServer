# MTranServer 
> Mini Translation Server

[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](README.md) | English

A high-performance offline translation server with minimal resource requirements - runs on CPU with just 1GB memory, no GPU needed. Average response time of 50ms per request.

Translation quality comparable to Google Translate.

Note: This model prioritizes performance optimization, so translation quality may not match that of large language models.
